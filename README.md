## SQL Analysis

The SQL scripts focus on Finding specific information from the Table.. Key SQL operations used include joins and aggregations.

- `Script.sql`: This file contains SQL queries for 3 very specific questions.

## Power BI Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard visualize the data in various formats to find the trends between type of crimes in different years. It also derives the results such as how many suspects are arrested or not.

`Dashboard.pdf` contains the printed dashboard from the power BI.
